                                PLASMA ToDo List
     __________________________________________________________________

Scheduler Specific

     * Polish synchronization
          + Make sure that locking is not excessive
          + Make sure that variables are not volatile if not necessary
     * Find the right criteria for renaming
          + Performance    close    to   out-of-place   for   codes   with
            anti-dependencies
          + No performance impact for codes without anti-dependencies
     * Look into the performance of loop reversal (ACCUMULATOR)
     * Implement  a  work  stealing  policy  which  does not significantly
       deteriorate data reuse
     * Consider lock-less implementations of data structures (hash, list)
     __________________________________________________________________

Imminent

     * Implement new functionality using the dynamic scheduler
          + "communication avoiding" QR/LQ factorization
          + matrix inversion using Cholesky, LU and QR
     __________________________________________________________________

Short Term

     * GPU support
          + development of CUDA kernels at the granularity of thread block
            per tile
          + integration of GPU kernels with the dynamic scheduler
     * Modular and extendable system for testing, timing and autotuning
          + simple template for adding a new routine
          + small number of executables (ideally one)
          + precision generation for multiple precisions
     __________________________________________________________________

Long Term

     * Mechanism for multithreaded library interoperability
          + sharing  of  threads  between,  e.g., PLASMA and multithreaded
            BLAS
     * Development of a front-end for coding linear algebra algorithms
          + SMPSs-like  extensions  for  annotating  tasks and simplifying
            task queuing
          + extensions for easily accessing elements of matrices stored in
            tile format
     * Development of SVD and Eigenvalue routines
